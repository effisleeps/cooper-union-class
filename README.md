African Heads Of State Project
===========================================================

My project is to create a code that investigates and if feasible, visually compiles current twitter discussions concerning African Heads of State.

My project will work in two phases:

```
1. Figuring out a method to receive, store and compare tweets from a twitter search regarding individual African heads of State. The key factors in this stage are being able to identify, without user monitoring, important words that indicate the content of discussion and appropriately sort received tweets with this criteria.
```
```
2. Building a website that will display the above information in an interesting, interactive fashion that both allows the user to become informed socio-politically and provides alternate information to branch out in this information exploration (e.g. using google's Api).
```
